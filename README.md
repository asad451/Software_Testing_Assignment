# Software_Testing_Assignment

The task was to generate a test set, using the Category Partition Method, to generate test inputs for
the Java SDK for parsing dates and times according to the RFC1123 standard. Having generated
the test inputs, you should then use Metamorphic testing to generate a set of Metamorphic relations
that apply to the parser, and to use these to generate second set of inputs.
